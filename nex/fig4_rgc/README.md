# Retinal Ganglion Cell Task

In this task, we are fitting parameters of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) to the protocol of Ran et al. 2020.

The first 5 notebooks of this folder all perform preprocessing of the data and write the resulting dataframes to `results/data/...`:

- `01_setup.ipynb` reads the data from zenodo and organizes it into a single df. It also computes to center position of the image stimulus. This will be read by the next four notebooks.
- `02_labels.ipynb` denoises the calcium data (via receptive field estimation) and thereby produces the labels that will be used for training.
- `03_recording_meta.ipynb` writes a dataframe which contains all info about recordings: (x,y,z) of the ROI, and which jaxley branch and compartment that corresponds to.
- `04_bc_output.ipynb` computes the output of bipolar cells (BCs). This is done as a linear filter for the OPL and a nonlinearity for the BCs (Schwartz et al 2012).
- `05_stimuli_meta.ipynb` computes the jaxley branches and compartments that are within the receptive fields of Biopolar cells.

Finally, the notebook `06_simulate_rgc.ipynb` reads all the data generated by the notebooks above and defines the `jaxley` simulation.
